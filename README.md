# 📊 Job Market Dashboard (2020–2024)

A multi-source data analysis project that explores trends in the U.S. tech job market using datasets from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and other job boards. 

This project analyzes demand for roles, skills, and locations over time to uncover actionable insights for job seekers, hiring managers, and labor analysts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Between 2020 and 2024, the job market for tech professionals evolved significantly due to the pandemic, the rise of remote work, and economic shifts. This project aggregates and analyzes multiple job posting datasets to identify:

- In-demand job titles and skills over time
- Geographic trends in tech hiring (remote vs on-site)
- Salary distributions and growth in different states

> 💡 The project is being expanded into an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to allow dynamic exploration of these trends by students.
