# Week 3: Scraping Dynamic Websites with Selenium

### Overview
In Week 3, we’ll transition from static websites to more complex, **dynamic websites**. 
We’ll introduce **Selenium**, a powerful tool for automating web browsers and scraping dynamic content. 

### Key Topics:
- **Selenium**: 
  - Setting up Selenium for web scraping.
  - Navigating and interacting with dynamic web elements.

  - Extracting content rendered by JavaScript.

### Dynamic Websites in Focus:
By the end of this week, you’ll be comfortable in scraping data from websites that load content dynamically, preparing ourselves for scraping job postings where static scraping isn’t sufficient.
