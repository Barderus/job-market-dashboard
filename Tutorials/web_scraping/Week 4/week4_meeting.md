- **For next week**: I will search the advantages of using Llama for data analysis on the collected scraped data. (Anyone is free to search it up as well)
  - **If Viable**: We can consider scraping data from any of the following job sites:
    - Indeed
    - ZipRecruiter
    - Glassdoor
    - LinkedIn
    - SimplyHired
    - Monster
    - JobList
    - USAJobs
  - **If Not Viable**: These sites have structured HTML elements (classes and IDs) that could help us in the data scrapping:
    - Glassdoor (possibly)
    - SimplyHired
    - Monster
    - JobList
  - **For Long-Text Pages**: We could use list comprehensions and split data based on keywords like "Job Qualifications" to get the important information.
