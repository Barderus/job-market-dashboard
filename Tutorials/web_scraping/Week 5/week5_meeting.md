## Meeting Overview

In this meeting, we divided the team into smaller groups, using a divide-and-conquer approach to scrape as much data as possible.

### Team Assignments

- **Team 3:** Cory, Daniel  
  *Focus: Glassdoor website*
  * Got the class names, getting everything together.

### Summary
This week, we analyzed the structure of various websites and took initial steps in data collection.


PS: If we get too many road blocks with getting our IP blocked, we can look into getting private proxies:
  - Option 1: https://oxylabs.io/pricing/residential-proxy-pools
  - Option 2: https://www.proxy-cheap.com/pricing/rotating-residential-proxy
