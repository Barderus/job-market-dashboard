# Week 2: Advanced Web Scraping and Pandas

### Overview
In Week 2, we’ll practice our web scraping skills and introduce **Pandas** for data manipulation. We’ll work with **DataFrames** to handle structured data and scrape from more well-known websites like **Wikipedia**.

### Key Topics:
- **DataFrames**: Exploring Pandas to create, manipulate, and analyze tabular data.
- **Web Scraping**: 
  - Expanding our scraping efforts with more complex websites.
  - Handling tables and structured data from sources like Wikipedia.

### Transition to Dynamic Websites:
This week will be our final focus on static websites, as we gear up to solve challenges such as **dynamic web pages** starting next week.

By the end of this week, you’ll be comfortable using Pandas and scraping data from structured sources, preparing you for more dynamic scraping challenges ahead.
